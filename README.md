# Mac Setup

- [System Update](#system-update)
- [System Preferences](#system-preferences)

## System Update

First thing you should always do is update your system so **Apple Icon > Software Update...**

## System Preferences

Some tweaks I like to do right away...  Do as you prefer with these.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Text > Uncheck all options, especially _use smart quotes and dashes_
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock and position on screen to Right
