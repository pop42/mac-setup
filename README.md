## System Update

First thing you should always do is update your system so **Apple Icon > Software Update...**

## System Preferences

Some tweaks I like to do right away... Do as you prefer with these.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Text > Uncheck all options, especially _use smart quotes and dashes_
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock and position on screen to Right
- Sharing > Change your computer name to something shorter and nicer... I used **vault72**

## Google Chrome

You need a good browser... [Google Chrome](//google.com/chrome) is my favorite. Download the _.dmg_ file, click to install and follow instructions.

Afterwards, I suggest signing into chrome with your google account and syncing.

## LastPass

If you have it synced from your earlier google accounts, you can just log into it. Otherwise, download it, install it and use it for your passwords.

## Fonts

Because you will be working with fonts all day long, it's a good idea to download a font you like. Because you will be writing code, you need a good mono-spaced font to work with. Lately I have been happy with [inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?selection.family=Inconsolata). I suggest downloading it, unzipping it and installing it. After you unzip it you install it by doubleclicking on the .ttf files and clicking install.

## iTerm2

You will spend a lot of time on the command-line... install a good one. I suggest [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). Download it, unpack it, then drag it into Applications.

Open iTerm2 by hitting **cmd+spacebar** and typing _iterm_. Follow the instructions to give it full disk access.

Since you will be using iterm so much, let's make it prettier.

In **iTerm2 > Preferences** on the **General** tab, uncheck everything in the _Closing_ section.

In the tab **Profiles**, create a new one with the "+" icon, and rename it to your first name for example. Then, select **Other Actions... > Set as Default**. Finally, under the section **Window**, change the size to something better, like **Columns: 125** and **Rows: 35**.

In the tab **Colors** choose a preset from the dropdown in the bottom right and adjust to your liking. I usually take _solarized light_. I just like the way it looks.

In the **Text** tab, click **Change Font** and select your favorite monospaced font such as _Inconsolata_ at 14pt.

In the **Terminal** tab, check **Unlimited scrollback**. Also, because I don't like sounds, check **Silence bell**.

You will also need some dotfiles to do all the good stuff. _.bash_profile_ is called first, then it calls in the rest. To get you started, pull down the three I have here:

When done, hit the red "X" in the upper left (saving is automatic in OS X preference panes). Close the window and open a new one to see the size change.

## Dotfiles

You will need some good dotfiles to finish up your iterm setup. I have three great ones to get you started... just run the following in your terminal to download a [.aliases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.aliases),[.bash_profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.bash_profile), [.bash_prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.bash_prompt)

Copy and paste this in your terminal:

    cd ~
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.aliases
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.bash_profile
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.bash_prompt
    ls -la

Close and reopen your terminal once again and marvel at its beauty!

## Homebrew

A great way to install and manage many of the utilities you will need. Open iTerm2 by hitting **cmd+spacebar** and typing _iterm_. Then type **xcode-select --install** and hit return. This will install xcode which will is needed for everything else.

Now `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` to install homebrew. You will have to type in your password once, but after this, you really should not ever need to _sudo_ again to install items.

# Git

Gotta have it.

`brew install git`

To allow bash-completion in git, `brew install bash-completion`

Now lets get it configured a bit.

`cd ~ && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/.gitconfig` will give you some nice colors for the status, branch and diff commands

also.. set your user info:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

And your osKeyChain so you don't have to keep typing your password over and over.

    git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
    git config -l

## VScode

You need an editor to work in. VSCode is pretty awesome and works for both macs and windows. Download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx) unzip it, and drag it to the Applications directory.

After installing vscode, open it from Applications, hit cmd+shift+P to open the Command Pallet, type _shell_ and select _install code command in path_. Now you can type _code ._ from anywhere to open vscode to your current directory. Or _code ~/projects/whatever_ to automatically open up that directory or file in vscode.

To set some great initial settings for vscode, go to [vscode_settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/vscode_settings.json) and copy the content. Then with vscode active, go to **code > preferences > settings** with **user settings** selected, click on the elipses (...) on the right and select **open settings.json** and replace the content with what you copied from my vscode_settings.

To get the associated extensions, copy from [vscode_extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pop42/mac-setup/master/vscode_extensions) and paste in your terminal. Then close vscode and reopen to see the new extensions.

# node

We will install node via _nvm_. To install nvm, go to [nvm install](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) and find the curl command to run. It looks something like `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`

Then close your terminal, reopen it and type `command -v nvm` and if you see `nvm` as a response, you are good to go.

To install the latest node version, type `nvm install node`. To learn more about using nvm, go to [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Now install a few useful global modules we are currently using:

    npm i -g jest npm-check sequelize-cli serverless

# awscli

If you are working directly with aws, you might need the awscli

    brew install awscli

# Docker

Download and install [docker for mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac). I believe they new ask you to login before downloading...

# Projects

I generally create a ~/projects directory and use it for most all the development work I do. Within that directory, I may create a /personal and a /work directory to separate my personal work from my actual work.
